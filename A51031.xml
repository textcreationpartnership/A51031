            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <l>HOW cruelly do Poets rack their Brains!</l>
               <l>For small Applause, and little or no gains;</l>
               <l>Courting your sick and squeamish Appetite,</l>
               <l>Still with fresh pleasure, and a new delight.</l>
               <l>They strive to please you, with no little pain,</l>
               <l>And try to humor you in every strain,</l>
               <l>From the high Rant, of Thundring, Rhimeing Verse,</l>
               <l>To mimic Baudy Droll, and humble Farce.</l>
               <l>Lovers from every place, of every Age,</l>
               <l>Their Tragic Muse have brought upon the Stage,</l>
               <l>Whilst Comick Satyr strove to represent</l>
               <l>All sorts of Fools, to give you all content.</l>
               <l>Poets have robb'd the Earth, Heav'n, Air and Seas</l>
               <l>Of Objects, trying every way to please,</l>
               <l>With Songs, with Dances, and with painted Scenes,</l>
               <l>With Drums, with Trumpets, and with fine Machines,</l>
               <l>They've shewn you Angels, Spirits, Devils too,</l>
               <l>Hoping to find some way to pleasure you</l>
               <l>With something that was very rare and new:</l>
               <l>All this for you have drudging Poets done,</l>
               <l>Losing the dear-bought Fame they once had won.</l>

               <l>You come not now sharp set, pleas'd with each bit</l>
               <l>Of Tragic Sense, and season'd Comic Wit;</l>
               <l>But now you come with Stomachs, as if full,</l>
               <l>Tast nothing, but cry out, the Poets dull.</l>
               <l>Not much unlike to an ill-natur'd Guest,</l>
               <l>Who having fill'd his Belly, blames the Feast.</l>
               <l>When you'll scarce come to'a noted Poets Treat,</l>
               <l>Or when you do, will hardly like the Meat,</l>
               <l>Our Poet fears, cloy'd with such various Feasts,</l>
               <l>He shan't find any thing to please our Guests:</l>
               <l>That nothing with pall'd Appetites will down,</l>
               <l>Unless he brings some Fruit you have not known.</l>
               <l>Poets have been so lavish and so kind,</l>
               <l>New Characters are very hard to find,</l>
               <l>And all the Fools, Court, City, Country yield,</l>
               <l>Already have been muster'd in this Field:</l>
               <l>But he at last did on some Mad-Men light,</l>
               <l>With whom he'll entertain you here to Night;</l>

                  <p>O Sir, My Master has taken Physick to dayâ€” a kind of grumbling came over his Maw, which I doubt was a Surfeit got by eating of Rashers of Bacon and poatch'd Eggs th'other day, with his Nephew <hi>Furnish:</hi> but Doctor <hi>Quibus,</hi> the gibberishâ€” sputter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>French</hi> Doctor, tells him it is Melancholy, and that he must purge it away.</p>

                  <p>Why, it lay in my way, and I was passing the Fields, as a man does a Ford in a River, as suddenly as I can, I long to be out of them, they stink of City-Dog-house. But you I see are taking your serious turns here, as if it were for Recreation or Meditation, or that you took more delight in <hi>Moor-Fields</hi> than in the Train-swept-<hi>Malt,</hi> or glorious <hi>Hide-Park.</hi>

                  <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, here are Recreations indeed, to see the Wenches dry their Cloaths, and the Boys play at Grass-Cat, the Archers in <hi>Finsbury</hi> to shoot at Rovers, and Nine-pin-Alleys, and Bawdy-houses in every Quarter; what other Recreations canst find?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fair.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, all the Varieties thou canst imagine. Oh the several sorts of People that walk in these Fields, the Saint, the Sot, the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30808:6"/> Cheat, the Cully, the Grave, the Frollick, the Wise, the Fool, the Melancholy, the Religious, the Fanatic, the Usurers, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, the Alchymists, the Quacks, the Shop-keeper, from the Mercer to the Cobler, and Stocking-mender, with all their Wives, Daughters, Neeces and Maidens.</p>

                     <hi>Fairly</hi> reckoned, you forgot the Mad-men too, in <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> they make part of the Rarities. But methinks St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park, and the fair <hi>Bevie,</hi> that is there to be seen every Night, should have more attraction. The bright, fair, bucksom, witty, fine, will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and airy Girles at that end of the Town, should give more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light than green Aprons, and Grogaram Gowns or Petticoats that stink of Soap and Tallow, or the Cypress Chests and Lavender.</p>

                  <speaker>Fair.</speaker>
                  <p>Every man as he likes.

Why Faith <hi>Will.</hi> this place is not without those Creatures, and plenty of them too, of all sorts and sizes, though perhaps not so well <hi>prinkum prankum'd,</hi> or so modishly rigg'd: These are a sort of demure Whores, with little Rings upon their Foreheads, a strait Hood, and a narrow diminitive Colverteen Pinner, that makes them look so Saint-like, that you would swear 'em the Daughters of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence it self.</p>

                  <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
                  <p>This is something to the purpose, I like the place the better for that; but prethe be plain with thy Friend, and do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal thy Intrigue: who is it you are in quest of, that has so strong a Cart-Rope, as to draw thee from all the fine things in the Mall, to these stinking Tents of Bottle Ale and rusty Bacon? sure 'tmust be some rare piece: Or art thou cloy'd with Partridge and Pheasant, and long'st after Hung-Beef, musty Swines-flesh, or Rashers on the dirty Coales?</p>

                  <speaker>Fair.</speaker>
                  <p>You are still besides the Mark <hi>Will.</hi> 'tis no ordinary Game that I hunt in these Fields.</p>

                  <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
                  <p>Why so sly <hi>Frank?</hi> I never had a Miss or Intrigue yet, but I discovered it to thee; this is unkindly, the very Air of this place spoils your good nature.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fair.</speaker>
                  <p>I will tell you then, I am damnably, desperately, deeply in Love, and so have bin several Moneths too, and with an honest, witty, beautiful, well-bred, discreet, young Lady, and one that has Money boy to boot.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
                  <p>To have bin in Love for several Moneths, is no such strange thing, with a witty, beautiful, well-bred, discreet, young Lady; but if she be honest, and you cannot hope to make her other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, what do you do with her?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fair.</speaker>
                  <p>I see you follow your old Game <hi>Will</hi>â€” But I assure thee, mine is an honourable and lawful, and meer Matrimonial Design.</p>

                  <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
                  <p>Heavens forbidâ€” Matrimonial Love say you? thou
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30808:7"/> art not so intoxicated yet? what Marry, when all the World for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake their Wives, and fall to keeping? when 'tis grown as much out of Fashion as Trunk Breeches; thou hast convers'd fairly with <hi>Moor-Fields.</hi>

               <sp>

                  <p>Away, away, let's have no tilting against Marriage, the Theam is grown thred-bare, there is scarce a Comedy without it, the Poets and the Stage have laught at it so long, that they begin to be laught at themselves for it. I tell thee <hi>Will. Friendly,</hi> mine is a fair, honest, downright, Matrimonial-Love, with a very honest fair, young, witty Gentlewoman, and now, in truth, you have my whole Intrigue.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
                  <p>If it be so, I think thou art turned an honest, down-right, plain-dealing Sot. Dost not thou know that there is not a more unbecoming thing in Nature, than to see a Gentleman handing and waiting on his Wife.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fair.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis no matter for that, I have therefore withdrawn my self to this end of the Town, even to <hi>Moor-Fields,</hi> where 'tis no shame to do so; Men and their Wives ordinarily walk here together very lovingly.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Friend.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fair.</speaker>
                  <p>I believe it will grow in Fashion again, at the other end of the Town shortly: Misses are so very chargeable, humorsome, proud, impertinent and tyrannical, that no Wife in the World can be more. But I am resolv'd, and am not now to be shaken, therefore forbear.</p>

                  <speaker>Fair.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, you may in time, I am not shy, and I think need not be jealous of thee; for thou canst love nothing that's honest.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
                  <p>That's because I could never meet with that <hi>Chimoera,</hi> but you it seems, have found this rare Jewel.</p>

                  <p>Did you know her you would say so in Earnest, she is a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el out shewn in the Dark, which makes her Carbuncle-like, to shine the brighter.</p>

                  <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
                  <p>If it ben't i'the dark, 'tis such a hole, I should ne'r have sought for a Jewel in.</p>

                  <p>Why I'll tell thee, her name is <hi>Lucia,</hi> Well-bred, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Daughter, who dying, left her under the Guardianship of one Mr. <hi>Timothy Turbulent,</hi> whose Wife was Sister to her Father. Now he, with his hypocritical Sanctity, got so far into the Esteem of his Brother-in-Law, that he left his Daughter to his Care, with full power to see her bestowed in Marriage, but her Portion he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the safe keeping of the Chamber of <hi>London,</hi> which is 5000 Pounds.</p>

                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Sneak,</hi> I have met with a man, that has been this forty
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:30808:29"/> eight years studying a rare Project, and indeed, one that will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to all Curious Persons; and especially to Travellers; and he tells me, that now at last he has attained it; and that he shall have perfected his Design by that time the Patent can be got for it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sne.</speaker>
                  <p>Pray, Madam, what is this rare Invention you speak of?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, the Invention is extraordinary, it is a pair of Wings to fly into the Moon.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sne.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, that is not possible.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                  <p>How unreasonable you are now, not to believe another, and yet impose as impossible things on the Faith of others? And to tell you very freely, Mr. <hi>Sneak,</hi> my thoughts are, 'twill be sooner effected than most of those things you dream of: For you cannot but know, that <hi>Dedalus</hi> and <hi>Icarus</hi> could fly half way to the Moon; and of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others, that could fly from high Towers, like Kites, or Eagles.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sne.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, it would be an admirable way of Travelling; I'll speak to my Lady <hi>Medler</hi> about the Patent.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis good to speak in time: It will be of extraordinary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to you; and I hope, worth the <hi>Vertuoso</hi>'s while, labor and pains. He has studied all the Mathematicks, and run thorow the Philosophy of Atoms, of Weight and Gravity; weighed all sorts of Air, and lain whole days on his Back, to observe the Motions of Kites, Swallows, Doves, Batts, and Butterflies, making Comments and Observations on their several Motions; and now at last Mr. <hi>Sneak,</hi> this Flying Man, having brought his Wings to perfection, intends to visit the Moon shortly.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Se.</speaker>
                  <p>Let me advise him to get a Patent before he goes, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his Art to one, least he should miscarry: For I look upon the Voyage far more dangerous than that of <hi>Columbus,</hi> when he went in ursuit of the other World.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                  <p>As to the last, I may perhaps get him to communicate it to you: For he is almost afraid to own it after all, least he should be knock'd on the Head, by the Coachmen, Watermen and Seamen: For 'twill spoil their Trade. Besides, some have persuaded the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-men, that there will (if this Project goes forward) be such Clouds of Flying People in the Air, that 'twill hinder the Sun from ripening their Corn: So that he is afraid he shall be kill'd by them for the Invention; and he must be upon the Wing, out of the reach of shot, or in the Moon to secure himself.</p>

                  <speaker>Sne.</speaker>
                  <p>O Pray Madam, be not angry, I was engaged in a very grand Design, one of the best Projects I ever yet met with, very feasible and extreamly beneficial, which I will communicate to your Ladyship.</p>

                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Sneak,</hi> I have met with a Project this day, so extraordinary, and so exceeding beneficial, both to us, and to the whole Kingdom, that I hug my self, to have been so happy as to hear the first Proposition of it, from the <hi>Vertuoso</hi> himself â€” I will take you in for a Share, Mr. Sneak, we will make one another happy â€”</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sne.</speaker>
                  <p>Madam, you honour your Servant, pray what is it?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>La. Med.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, there is a person come to Town, that was with me this day, that proposes to build a Fleet of Sheeps all of <hi>Portland</hi> Stone, to save the Woods which begin to grow thin, and Timber scarce; and he will undertake to build them so thick, that no Bullet shall pierce them. Then we shall have Castles indeed floating on the Seas, as a modern Poet says.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sne.</speaker>
                  <p>Sure that is not feasible, which way can he do it; he must sheath them all with Cork sure?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La. Med.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, which way he does it, is a Secret; but he has brought it to Demonstration already by a little one, the very Yards and Masts are all of Stone too.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sne.</speaker>
                  <p>But the Tackle and Sales are not made of Stone too, I hope.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La. Med.</speaker>
                  <p>No â€” but they are not of Hemp nor Canvass.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sne.</speaker>
                  <p>What then?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>La. Med.</speaker>
                  <p>Because we may not be beholden to Forreign Nations, and to promote the Growth of our own Nation, all the Sales are made of Tinn, and the Shrouds, Tackle and Cables of twisted Wires. What need we then care for <hi>Denmark</hi> or <hi>Norway?</hi>

                  <p>'Tis admirable; and if he can but convince me by Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I shall look upon it as the most happy thing I ever light on. I beseech you, Madam, promote it for the Good of the Nation.</p>

If it were not for such as he, Fools having the Favor of Fortune, would not know what to do with their Money. 'Tis they get Riches, and such as he ease them of the Burthen. They do but dispend their money for them, and set it into motion.</p>
